<blockquote>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Chemometrics is what
  chemometricians do.&nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Chemometricians are people who drink beerand
  steal ideas from statisticians.&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">These jocular definitions belong to Swedish scientist Swante
  Wold, who (together with Bruce Kowalski) introduced the term chemometrics in
  the early 1970s.&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">Chemometrics is a new science that has no strict definition.
  The more official definition (by Massart) says that - Chemometrics is the
  chemical discipline that uses mathematical, statistical and other methods
  employing formal logic -&nbsp;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;to design or select optimal measurement procedures
      and experiments, and&nbsp;</li>
    <li>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;to provide maximum relevant chemical information by
      analyzing chemical data.&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
  <p align="left">However this definition is as ambiguous as the definition of
  geometry as the geodetic discipline that uses mathematical methods to measure
  distances and squares on earth. Being conceived as a branch of analytical
  chemistry, chemometrics now is a general approach. It extracts relevant
  information out of measured data, regardless of their origin: chemical,
  physical, biological, and etc. Chemometrics has been applied in different
  areas, and most successfully in multivariate calibration, pattern recognition,
  classification and discriminant analysis, multivariate modeling, and
  monitoring of processes. The main chemometric principle is a concept of hidden
  data structures that can be found using methods of multivariate data analysis.
  These are the well-known statistic tools such as partial least squares (PLS),
  soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA), principal-component
  regression (PCR), wavelet analysis, and many others. Current activities of
  chemometricians fall into two main two categories: (1) development of new
  methods for manipulating multivariate data and (2) new applications of the
  known chemometric techniques in different areas such as environment control,
  food industry, agriculture, medicine, and engineering.&nbsp;</p>

  <p align="left">In this book we collected papers of scientists, who
  participated in the Third Winter School (now, Symposium) on Chemometrics (<a href="index.html">WSC-3</a>) held in Russia, in Pushkinskie Gory village (near Pskov city), 2004.
  The conference is a regular event in the <a href="../drushba.htm"> DRUSHBAMETRICS</a> (&quot;friendship-metrics&quot;)
  project, established in 1999 by the Danish scientist Kim H. Esbensen and his
  Russian colleagues Oxana Rodionova and Alexey Pomerantsev. The overall
  objective of DRUSHBAMETRICS is to provide young (and young-at-heart)
  scientists and specialists an opportunity to get acquainted with chemometric
  multivariate data analysis. An equally important goal is to facilitate
  international networking with colleagues from abroad. WSC has become a place
  mainly for presenting new ideas and fruitful discussions in a friendly
  informal atmosphere.</p>
  <p align="left">Scientists from Austria, Belarus, Canada, Denmark, Finland,
  Iran, Norway, Sweden, and Russia presented their work for this book. Among
  them there are the world famous specialists such as Rolf Ergon (Norway), Paul
  Geladi (Sweden), Kim Esbensen (Denmark), Kurt Varmuza (Austria), as well as
  the young researchers who make the first steps in chemometrics. We hope that
  this collection will open a series of the DRUSHBAMETRICS books dedicated to
  chemometrics and its applications.&nbsp;</p>
