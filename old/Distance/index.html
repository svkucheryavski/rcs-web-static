        programme: <a href="http://siu.no/en/Programme-overview/Nordic-Russian-cooperation-in-education-and-research/Projects-selected-for-support">Nordic

		<p align="left"><b><font size="4">Background&nbsp;</font></b></p>
		<p align="left">In the last two decades, considerable advances in
        measuring instruments have made possible their on-line use in different
        industrial processes resulting in obtaining huge sets of data. At the
        same time, progress in computer engineering allowed these data sets not
        only to be collected and stored but also to be processed. The data
        related to for example process control, product quality control,
        environmental monitoring, etc. are generally multivariate and it is
        difficult to determine relative importance of the measured variables.
        Classical statistical approach has definite limitations in solving
        similar tasks and multivariate methods are essential in processing such
        data sets.&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="left">Chemometrics as a multivariate data analysis represents
        the modern approach to modeling different processes allowing to handle
        large data sets and to analyze links existing in the system under study.
        Nowadays chemometrics applications cover a wide range of industrial and
        scientific tasks. Chemometric methods have found their use in the food,
        pharmaceutical, pulp and paper, petrochemical, and chemical industries.
        Environmental monitoring is also the area where the multivariate
        approach is intensively used. In the research field, chemometrics
        originated from processing NIR-spectra data finds nowadays the wide use
        and has revolutionized for example biological investigations when
        applying to handling metabonomics and metabolomics data.&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="left">Presently an engineer and a researcher face increasingly
        with a need to use mathematical and statistical methods in their
        everyday practice and it is essential for them to master chemometric
        approach to multivariate data processing. A number of Nordic
        Universities have a great experience in chemometrics education, which
        could be shared with the Russian University partners. On the other hand,
        the Russian partners have developed an outline of the internet-based
        chemometric learning program, which could be of interest to the Nordic
        partners, including special software in Excel. This cooperation could
        result in developing of a new Mastership Chemometrics program with
        emphasis on distance and virtual learning. The submitted project
        combines the partners represented by Nordic and North-West Russia's
        Universities including those who are interested in working out Master's
        Degree Programmes for Chemical and Environmental Engineers and a
        Research institution dealing with theoretical studies in chemometrics.</p>
		<p align="left"><b><font size="4">The goal&nbsp;</font></b></p>
		<p align="left">of the project is to enhance a long term partners'
        cooperation in developing of a new Mastership Chemometrics program with
        emphasis on distance and virtual learning.</p>
		<p align="left"><b><font size="4">Project Partners and Their
        Responsibilities&nbsp;</font></b></p>
		<p align="left">The project partners have a long-term scientific
        cooperation history. The project outlines have previously been discussed
        during the partners meetings at the chemometric conferences <a href="../WSC5/index.html">WSC-5</a>
        (Samara, 2006), <a href="http://www2.lut.fi/kete/ssc10/index.html"> SSC-10</a> (Lappeenranta, 2007), and <a href="../WSC6/index.html">WSC-6</a>
        (Kazan, 2008). The partners constitute a congruous team in which all
        members play their individual role. The team includes the following
        partners.&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="left"><u><a href="http://www.gturp.spb.ru/engl.htm">Saint Petersburg State Technological University of
        Plant Polymers (SPb STUPP)</a></u>, an applicant and a project coordinator,
        - is the only higher educational establishment in the Russian Federation
        providing integrated training of specialists for industrial enterprises
        engaged in in-depth chemical processing of wood as well as for power
        sector. The majority of University graduates work in the forest, pulp
        and paper industries, the chemical industry, the power sector of Russia,
        CIS and foreign countries. These are the industries where on-line
        multivariate data analysis is strongly required in many manufacturing
        aspects as it has been demonstrated in a lot of applied studies carried
        out by other project partners. Because of this, the university is making
        efforts to include chemometrics training components into its educational
        process. SPb STUPP will contribute to the network with voluntary work on
        organization of the one-day workshop on theoretical and applied
        chemometrics issues in Saint Petersburg as well as with compiling a data
        base on the available chemometrics training courses (in-kinds
        contribution).&nbsp;</p>

        technology and economics financed by the Ministry of Education
        (Finland). LUT`s areas of strength are related to the forest industry
        and metal clusters, electrical engineering, energy, economics as well as
        to information and communication technologies. LUT`s location on the
        border between the EU and Russia has also had a major impact on the
        university's activities and orientation. LUT provides a range of
        international study opportunities. For example, there are nine
        international programmes in technology and business offered in English.
        There have also been established programmes in so called double diploma
        scheme, between LUT and SPb STUPP in particular. The LUT contribution
        will come out through Chemometrics Group (Laboratory of Chemistry) which
        is well known both nationally and internationally. Research and teaching
        of chemometrics has been started in early 1980's. Application areas have
        covered both academically and industrially interesting topics. The most
        well-known members of the group are Prof. Pentti Minkkinen and D.Sc.
        Satu-Pia Reinikainen, who has contributed internationally in organizing
        several international conferences, as well as, acted as editors for
        several years in various editorial tasks for Elsevier and Wiley. The
        Group has been a partner in an EU funded Network of Excellence: Virtual
        Institute for Chemometrics and Industrial Metrology (VICIM), together
        with 12 other international partners. The group also holds chemometric
        courses on regular bases on the M. Sc. and higher levels. Distance and
        e-Learning methods constitute a part of most educational programmes of
        LUT.&nbsp;</p>

        expanding cooperation in both educational and research fields, involving
        students, post-graduates, teachers and researchers through their
        participation in project activities. The latter will also contribute to
        further development of university cooperation in the frameworks of the
