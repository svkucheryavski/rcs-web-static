<p>Russian scientific school that studies application of mathematical methods in chemistry
has been existing for many years. The achievements of academicians Semenov and Zeldovich
turned to be its basis. The main activity of scientists that belong to the school is
mainly connected with the description of the kinetics of chemical processes. </p>

<p>Regular conferences &quot;Mathematical methods in chemistry&quot; were held in the
Soviet Union. In spite of that, such activities were not connected with a term
&quot;Chemometrics&quot; as a name of some special field of knowledge. Only few years ago
it was found out that everything we had been doing was called Chemometrics. In brief, we
are involved in 

<ul>
  <li>interpretation of data (Elena V. Bystritskaya, ICP); </li>
  <li>investigation of nonlinear regression statistics (Alexey L. Pomerantsev, ICP); </li>
  <li>designing of experiments (Yury P. Adler, Yury V. Granovskiy, Moscow University); </li>
  <li>environmental monitoring (Vladimir G. Gorsky , Institute of Organic Chemistry);</li>
  <li>special software producing (Oxana Ye. Rodionova, ICP); </li>
  <li>thermodynamics application (Yevgeny B Rudnyi, Moscow University);</li>
</ul>

<p>We consider the modern status of Chemometrics in Russia to be unsatisfactory: 

<ul>
  <li>no specialised journals on Chemometrics are subscribed; </li>
  <li>Chemometrics as a scientific discipline is not accepted by the Russian Academy of
    Science; </li>
  <li>the novel methods in Chemometrics are hardly accessible for Russian scientists.</li>
</ul>

<p>To change this situation a group of scientists from the Institute of Chemical Physics,
Moscow State University, and some other research centres in Moscow (about 25 persons) met
together in October 1997 and decided to establish the Russian Chemometrics Society (RCS).
The main goals of such non-profit scientific association are: 

<ul>
  <li>to accustom Russian scientists to Chemometrics and to create the conditions for its
    further development;</li>
  <li>to support researches in Chemometrics</li>
  <li>to carry out scientific seminars and conferences;</li>
  <li>to maintain contacts between scientists on problems of Chemometrics;</li>
  <li>to promote educational courses on Chemometrics;</li>
  <li>to gather information on Chemometrics, in order to provide it for scientists and
    students.</li>
</ul>

<p>Only now do we make the first steps in the long procedure of official registration. In
concordance with state rules, not less than 50 regional departments of RCS in the country
should be open before the Society Congress could be held. I hope we will finish this
procedure some where in autumn (optimistic forecast!). It is difficult to count, now, the
exact number of members, because after the announce of intention to create RCS we began to
receive e-mails from different parts of the country, where scientists wanted to join us. </p>

<p>Of course our main problem now is where to get money to gain our main purposes. The
membership in RCS is dues free. No committee members get any compensation for their work.
Now, our demure expenses are granted by Polycert (a small independent research company).
We are supported by the Institute of Chemical Physics of Russian Academy of Science that
supplies us with official post address and Internet service. </p>

<p>Since October 1977 we made the following small but important steps. Every two months we
held Chemometrics seminars. Dr Y. Granovsky (Moscow University) published an article
&quot;The march and problems of Chemometrics&quot; (in Russian). We opened this Web-site
and try to maintain current information there. (It is in Russian but there is a little
English page too). Dr. Rudniy (Moscow University) with the support of Chemical Department
of Moscow University organised a mail server similar to the ICS-server, but in Russian. We
connected with Prof. Startsev, the Chief of Physical Department of Altai University. He
needs help in preparing Chemometrics course for his students. We are doing our best in
making Chemometrics known to a wider audience here in Russia. Thanks to the members of
organizing committee who work with enthusiasm and are interested both in the RCS and
Chemometrics itself. </p>

<p>We appreciate any assistance the ICS could grant us, but first of all we need
scientific information in paper or electronic form.</p>
